## ***Updated CISC. 4900 Project v2 (deprecated)

# NowServiceIt

## Description
This is a project for my final semester for CISC 4900. 
Where I want to work on a web program that would help with streamlining the tech support/inquiry ticketing process. With the intent of providing a user-friendly interface for submitting, tracking, and resolving support requests, improving efficiency for both users and support team(s)

## Technologies Used
I personally plan on hopefully making this a web based browser app.
Where I plan on using Javascript (via Next.JS), CSS, React, and Mongo.DB. 

## Other Details
This is a project where it will be supervised under an Employee of KPMG under their business support services. (More info will be provided through out the course of this project)

## **IMPORTANT
This is my current repo for the project after some challenges 
(This was started after the second demo recording as it became significantly harder to continue to maintain.)
